[b]DEV NOTES[/b]
[quote=About this mod]This is the first mod I make after a suggestion on my new requests thread ^^ The shiny red nose was originally proposed by unclekrusty and the force ride power was something that was requested some time ago when the City Bay map came out :)
So after gathering some ideas on the request thread, I ended with a well placed red apple and some warning red light I found in the game files for the nose, and I also added reinder-looking horns (using the tornado goat mask).
About the goat riding ability, there was not much to do: a function already exist for every NPC to make it ride your goat ^^ Anyway I had to tweak the position on your back for non human NPCs as they wer placed incorrectly. Also the way riding is done in the original code completely break NPCs so it's impossible to get them back alive an healthy after a ride (the only solution I see to do that is to clone them, but I already made a whole mod for that so I don't want to copy paste it in this one :p). Finally I added some general bug fixes to the riding mechanism to avoid as much as possible that you lose your rider unintentionally.
